# Introduction

Asclepios’s goal is to provide a toolkit to develop  reproducible, automated and traceable computational cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics workflows. Asclepios’s primary focus is on enabling Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD), with a particular emphasis on Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) strategies to process large sets of small molecules and macromolecules. Conventional strategies in SBDD can be designed as computational workflows. Asclepios toolkit is a set of data processing units able to connect with each other and compose a sophisticated computational workflow.
